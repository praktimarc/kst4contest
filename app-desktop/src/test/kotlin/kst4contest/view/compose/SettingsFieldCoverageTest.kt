/**
 * Guards against a setting quietly disappearing during the port.
 *
 * The JavaFX settings window called these ChatPreferences setters. Every one of
 * them must still be called from the Compose settings sources, or an operator
 * loses a setting they could configure before — and nothing about that fails to
 * compile.
 *
 * The list was derived mechanically: the setters called between settingsStage and
 * the Profiles tab, intersected with the setters ChatPreferences actually declares,
 * so JavaFX control setters like setDisable or setPrefWidth are excluded.
 *
 * This checks text occurrence, not runtime behaviour. It cannot tell whether a
 * setter is called with the right value, only that it is called at all. That is
 * little, but it is the only check that covers all of them mechanically.
