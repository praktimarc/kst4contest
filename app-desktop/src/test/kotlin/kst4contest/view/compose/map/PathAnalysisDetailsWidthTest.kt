/**
 * The value column keeps its share of a narrow analysis pane.
 *
 * Every row of this column pairs a label with a value, and the value is what an
 * operator reads: a locator, a distance, a propagation assessment. The JavaFX original
 * used a GridPane whose value column took the remaining width. The Compose port gave
 * the assessment label a fixed 130 dp instead, so once the splitter narrowed the pane
 * the label kept its 130 dp and the assessment was squeezed — visible as clipped text
 * in the 30 September screenshot.
 *
 * Measured on the rendered image rather than through a callback, so the production
 * composable carries nothing that exists only for this test. The assessment box is the
 * one opaque coloured band in the column, which makes its left edge findable.
