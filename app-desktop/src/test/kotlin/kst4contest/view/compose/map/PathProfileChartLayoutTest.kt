/**
 * The terrain profile chart has to survive being small.
 *
 * It is the only part of the map window that draws text onto a canvas whose size it
 * does not control: the splitter above it and the window around it both shrink it. A
 * canvas narrower than the chart's own margins puts the axis labels outside the canvas,
 * and Compose builds the text measurement constraints from the distance between the
 * label and the canvas edge — a distance that is negative once the label is outside.
