 * drawing code takes a viewport and paints, and no amount of reading it proves a dot
 * came out 12 px wide. These are the acceptance criteria of the projection rewrite and
 * of the grid planner, in the form the operator experiences them.
 *
 * Tiles never arrive here. The fetcher is asked asynchronously and the test renders one
 * frame, so what is measured is the map's own drawing over its own background — which is
