/**
 * Everything the main window draws, in one object.
 *
 * This is the shape the profile switch needs. Today a switch tears the runtime down and
 * builds a new Kst4ContestApplication, because the controls are inline-created instance
 * fields and there is no other way to be rid of them. Once the window is a pure function
 * of this object, switching profiles is replacing it — the reason the JavaFX version had
 * to restart itself is gone.
 *
 * Nothing here holds a window or a thread; those belong to the runtime that builds this. It
 * does hold three preference listeners, which is why [release] exists and has to be called
 * when the state is dropped.
