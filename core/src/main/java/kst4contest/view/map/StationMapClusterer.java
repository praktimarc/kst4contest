/**
 * Groups stations that sit on top of each other on screen.
 *
 * The rules come from the Leaflet map and are kept as they were, because an operator
 * has learned them: grouping is by screen cell rather than by distance, a cell holds a
 * bubble only from three stations upwards, grouping stops once the map is zoomed in far
 * enough to show everything, and two kinds of station are never hidden in a bubble.
 *
 * Screen based and not locator based on purpose. The problem being solved is too many
 * labels in one part of the window, and that is a question about pixels.
 *
 * The first Compose port replaced this with nearest-neighbour grouping at a fixed 50 px
 * from two stations upwards and never switched it off, which put a "2" bubble over
 * most of the map.
